## Motivation

* Manual surgery planning/verification is complex, prone to errors, and non-sterile.
* Clinical need for (semi)-automatic guidance.


### Research objective

Development of a classification algorithm that 1) infers the type of anatomy (and 2) the viewing direction) from a 2D X-ray image.
